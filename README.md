# Cosmo

![Preview](.github/preview.png)

Cosmo is a Fabric mod that adds integration with LuckPerms prefixes/suffixes into the server.
It also changes the chat format to make it look cleaner and more modern.

The format for prefixes/suffixes is base64 encoded json.
You can use the [MiniMessage Viewer](https://webui.advntr.dev/) for generating the JSON, and then encode it using the [Base64 Encoder](https://www.base64encode.org/).
